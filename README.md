# Neon Planaria Demo

This is the same app explained in the Neon Planaria Tutorial at https://neon.planaria.network

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/interplanaria/npd.git
```

# Run

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

In case you don't have docker installed yet, install Docker (Planaria itself doesn't require Docker, but this app does):

- [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Install Docker for Linux, etc.](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#server)

Now we're ready. First start Planaria:

```
node index
```

After Planaria has successfully started, open another terminal and start Planarium:

```
node server
```

And that's it!
